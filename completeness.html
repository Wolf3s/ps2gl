<h2>
Complete</h2>
Functions and such listed below should be as complete as they're going
to get and are fair game for bug reports.&nbsp;
<p>Be sure to check "Ain't no way" below for exceptions.&nbsp;
<p>Note: everything should work as well or as poorly for display lists
as for immediate execution.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
glBegin/End, glVertex3/4f, glNormal, glTexCoord2f</li>

<li>
glDrawArrays</li>

<li>
8/24/32 bit textures</li>

<li>
materials</li>

<li>
glMultMatrix, glRotate, Translate, Scale, Frustum..</li>

<li>
projection and modelview stacks -- depth is 16</li>

<li>
depth and alpha tests</li>

<li>
per-vertex diffuse material changes with glColorMaterial</li>

<li>
face culling (back/front)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Partially complete</h2>

<ul>
<li>
lighting -- no spots, only local_viewer for speculars</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Ain't no way</h2>
Here are some things that are not considered a priority, for various reasons.
Basically these are known to be missing/broken but are not on the todo
list. If you want something here and think it can be implemented efficiently,
let us know.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
no GL_LINE_LOOP - treated as a line strip</li>
</ul>
