<center><h1>Building ps2gl</h1></center>

<h2>Who can build it, and why</h2>

<p>Right now, building ps2gl requires a patched version of gcc, the ps2stuff
project, make, perl, and sed.  (The compiler patches can be found on the
ps2stuff homepage).  ps2gl will probably not build with CodeWarrior.

<p>The reason for using a patched version of gcc is only because some of the
ps2stuff header files contain code that require the patches, but this code is
not actually used by ps2gl.  This is an annoying restriction which should change
in the future.

<p>My reasoning for using gcc and not maintaining compatibility with CodeWarrior
is as follows:  gcc is the de facto standard from SCEI, so it needs to build
with gcc; the two compilers have very different strengths and weaknesses, and
rather than taking the lowest common denominator of both, I feel that it's
better to optimize for one compiler; at this point, most studios will have gcc
installed somewhere, so it's at least accessible to CodeWarrior users.

<p>Obviously, not using CodeWarrior makes things more difficult for a lot of
developers and warrants some discussion.  In that light, I'll make a forum on
the homepage for that purpose!

<h2>Building</h2>

<b>Linux/gcc</b>

<p>The only configuration necessary should be to set the 'PS2STUFF' variable so
that it points to the ps2stuff project.  After that 'make' should do it.  See
the comments at the top of the Makefile for more build targets.

<p>When writing the makefile for your own project, I've recently had to link in
this order (note that ps2gl is there twice): ps2gl ps2glut ps2gl ps2stuff.  Go
figure..

<p>
<b>Windows/gcc</b>

<p>??? - the Makefile uses several other programs to do its job (make, sed,
perl) which aren't normally present on Windows systems...  It shouldn't be
difficult to port the Makefile to windows;  in fact, it has been done, but I
don't have a copy of the results.  If any Windows users out there would like to
contribute their port, I'm sure it would be very welcome...
